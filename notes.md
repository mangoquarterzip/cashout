Example scenario demonstrated here:

BSC swaps are skipped as funds are already in native token
BSC calls ZETA
Network suggestion is made
Network is switched to Mumbai
Mumbai swaps are made
Mumbai calls ZETA
Network is switched to goerli
Goerli makes swap to native token

---- after 15 mins, all funds have arrived from ZETA chain to goerli

final swap is made with all funds which arrive in native gas token of gETH into desired token, in this case USDT
